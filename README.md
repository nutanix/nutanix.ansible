# Installing the collection
**Prerequisite**

Ansible should be pre-installed. If not, please follow official ansible [install guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) .

For <font color=royalblue>Developers</font>, please follow [this install guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html) for setting up dev environment.

**1. Clone the GitHub repository to a local directory**

```git clone https://github.com/nutanix/nutanix.ansible.git```

**2. Git checkout release version**

```git checkout <release_version> -b <release_version>```

**3. Build the collection**

```ansible-galaxy collection build```

**4. Install the collection**

```ansible-galaxy collection install nutanix-ncp-<version>.tar.gz```

**Note** Add <font color=red>`--force`</font> option for rebuilding or reinstalling to overwrite existing data

# Using this collection
You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as<font color=royalblue> nutanix.ncp.ntnx_vms</font>, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the <font color=royalblue>nutanix.ncp </font>collection in the playbook's ```collections:``` keyword

For example, the playbook for iaas.yml is as follows:
```yaml
---
- name: IaaS Provisioning
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  collections:
    - nutanix.ncp
  module_defaults:
    group/nutanix.ncp.ntnx:
      nutanix_host: <pc_ip>
      nutanix_username: <user>
      nutanix_password: <pass>
      validate_certs: true
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: external_subnet
    - include_role:
        name: vpc
    - include_role:
        name: overlay_subnet
    - include_role:
        name: vm
    - include_role:
        name: fip
```
To run this playbook, use <font color=royalblue>ansible-playbook</font> command as follows:
```
ansible-playbook <playbook_name>
ansible-playbook examples/iaas/iaas.yml
```

# Testing

## Integration Testing for Nutanix Ansible Modules

To conduct integration tests for a specific Ansible module such as the `ntnx_vms` module, the following step-by-step procedures can be followed:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you are in the installed collection directory where the module is located. For example:
`/Users/mac.user1/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/nutanix/ncp`

### Setting up Variables
1. Navigate to the `tests/integration/targets` directory within the collection.

2. Define the necessary variables within the feature-specific var files, such as `tests/integration/targets/prepare_env/vars/main.yml`, `tests/integration/targets/prepare_foundation_env/vars/main.yml`,`tests/integration/targets/prepare_ndb_env/tasks/prepare_env.yml`, etc.

Note: For Karbon and FC tests, use the PC vars exclusively, as these features rely on pc setup. Not all variables are mandatory; define only the required variables for the particular feature to be tested.

3. Run the test setup playbook for the specific feature you intend to test to create entities in setup:
    - For PC, NDB, and Foundation tests, execute the relevant commands:
      ```bash
      ansible-playbook prepare_env/tasks/prepare_env.yml
      ansible-playbook prepare_ndb_env/tasks/prepare_env.yml
      ansible-playbook prepare_foundation_env/tasks/prepare_foundation_env.yml
      ```

### Running Integration Tests
1. Conduct integration tests for all modules using:
    ```bash
    ansible-test integration
    ```

2. To perform integration tests for a specific module:
    ```bash
    ansible-test integration module_test_name
    ```
    Replace `module_test_name` with test directory name under tests/integration/targets.

### Cleanup
1. After completing the integration tests, perform a cleanup specific to the tested feature:
    - For PC tests, execute the command:
      ```bash
      ansible-playbook prepare_env/tasks/clean_up.yml
      ```
    - For Foundation tests, execute the command:
      ```bash
      ansible-playbook prepare_foundation_env/tasks/clean_up.yml
      ```

By following these steps, you can perform comprehensive integration testing for the specified Ansible module and ensure a clean testing environment afterward. Define only the necessary variables for the specific feature you intend to test.
